# ssm
Sprite Sheet Maker. Takes tiles and squashes them into one big sprite sheet. 

## assumptions
As I'm lazy. SSM currently makes the assumptions that:

* You are not providing loads of tiles to make a really big sprite sheet...
* All of the tiles are in PNG
* The tiles are rectangular, i.e. they are S * S
